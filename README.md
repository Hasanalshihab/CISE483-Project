# CISE483-Project

The program is designed to detect the faces passing by the camera and encode them using a function then return their value. The returned value from encoding will be compared with the faces in the dataset, which contains people faces in images with their names, and the image with highest similarity will be chosen. Afterwards, the program will assign the image label, which is the name of the person, and record the name with the specific time he was attended into a file.
